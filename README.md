# Ansuman Sharma

Computer Science student at the University of Kansas (Class of 2026) who loves building cool software, crafting intuitive user experiences, and turning big ideas into real-world impact! I've worked with **UiPath** as an Enterprise Success Intern and at Ascend Learning as a Software Engineer Intern. I'm always excited about fintech, edtech, and blockchain adventures.

I'm also minoring in Mathematics; it's been one of my favourite subjects both in school and in college! My efforts in Mathematics and Computer Science have helped me win 3 hackathons and 4 math competitions in college so far (more details below)!
